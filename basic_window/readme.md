## basic_window

The purpose of this project is to create a small, but complete program that renders a window using GLFW and can be expanded to include OpenGL calls.

To build this project there is an included Makefile within the src folder, though you'll probably have to update the compilation and linking flags (CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS) to reference the dependencies on OpenGL, and GLFW.
