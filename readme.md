# OpenGL Sample Projects
> This repository is for the sample projects and code snippets I develop using the core-profile modern OpenGL version 3.3 and GLFW. This project list will continue to expand over time.

To build each of these projects there is an included Makefile, though you'll probably have to update the compilation and linking flags (CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS) to reference the dependencies on OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM.

Also included in each project is a test directory (<project_name>/src/test) where regression tests can be built/run using the included run_tests bash script.
